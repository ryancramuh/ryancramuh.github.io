## Ryan's Fall 2025 Classes 

## [CPE 523](CPE523/cpe523.md) 

Digital system design. Go over manufacturing constraints, electrical constraints, and high-level design. Abstract design process into simpler and simpler steps. 

## [EE 431](EE431/EE431.md) 

CMOS VLSI design. Covers CMOS manufacturing techniques, sizing, parasitics, delay, and logical effort. We will use tools such as xschem, magic, and netgen to do spice, DRC, and LVS.

## [PHYS 425](PHYS425/PHYS425.md)

Solid State Physics with an emphasis on phonons, material properties, semiconductor physics, and mathematical descriptions/models of solids.

## [Capstone](../CAPSTONE/capstone.md)

Project class where we design a vehicle under the supervision of a client (Dr. Danowitz) who has tasked us with building a predictive car maintenance device. We plan on using accelerometers for predictive maintenance and integrating an app. 

## ISA for CPE 225 

 I tutor for Verilog, Syassembly language programming using RISC-V with a small amount of microprocessor design.
