C_EFF for the Pentium is 7.12e-09
C_EFF for the Pentium 4 is 1.66e-08
The power consumption would be 2.05 Watts
Thew new frequency would be 769230769.23 Hz

Number of Pentium 65nm cores needed: 8 
The power for 8 cores: 16.40 Watts

If I was an engineer working at Intel,
I would recommend using a multi-core Pentium design
because it offers equal performance for less power overall
The Pentium 4 requires 69.60330578512396 more watts for equal performance
