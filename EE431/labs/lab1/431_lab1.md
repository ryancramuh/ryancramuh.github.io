## Introduction
In Lab 1, we explore the CMOS logic family using modular design. We start by generating the circuit schematic for a simple CMOS Inverter, a 2-Input NAND, and a 2-Input NOR, with which we can make any other logic gate/device. Once we make LTSpice symbols for our primitive logic gates, we use them construct a 2-to-1 Mux and a 4-to-1 Mux.

## Methodology: 
- [ ] How we built the final circuit 4-to-1 Mux from logic gates
- [ ] Screenshot of inverter
- [ ] Screenshot of NAND
- [ ] Screenshot of NOR
- [ ] Screenshot of 2-to-1 MUX
- [ ] Screenshot of 4-to-1 MUX
- Simulation of parametric inverter and 4-to-1 MUX

## Result:
- [ ] Result of parametric analysis with inverter and capacitor
- [ ] Result of the 4-to-1 MUX
- [ ] Explain in a few words what this signifies

## Discussion
- [ ] Describe what you learned from this analysis and the challenges you faced
