### Homework 1 due Monday, Jan 12 

1. On the library web site find the IEEE RFIC symposium materials. I have links to the
abstracts from this conference on canvas for the years 2023, 2024, and 2025. These
are the types of Integrated Circuits we will be working on in this class.
The first thing I ask is to scan through the entire set of abstracts for 2025 in order to
see the types of designs that are being discussed on their applications.
Then select 2 papers from the conference and down load them from the Cal Poly
library web site. Read through the conference submission. Using your own
summary or an effective Al summary. Become familiar with the terminology and the
accomplishments of the conference submission. Provide documentation on the
summary you pursued and upload to the canvas homework site. 

2. Read through chapter 1 in the Neaman text book. Enumerate the types of
semiconductor materials that are used in the various UMS processes. 

3. Do a web search on Molecular Beam Epitaxy. In cartoon format, provide an
explanation of how MBE works. Also explain the types of materials that are used in
MBE machines.
